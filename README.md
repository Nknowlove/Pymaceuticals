# Pymaceuticals

Assignment Task
This assignment compares the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. 

Instruction
1.	First of all, import the files and functions we need. And then merge two files for the next step. In this part, I was trapped by dropping the duplicate mouse. It took me lot of time to figure it out. I tried to locate all duplicates mouse with ID=g989 and drop them with “!=” syntax.
2.	Following that, Creating a data frame of summary statistics is easy. 
3.	When I built the pie chart, I had a problem. I used the cleaned data frame to do the value count. It made my percentage number for both male and female mice uncorrected. I took half an hour to modify it. I should use a cleaned data frame and drop duplicates by mouse ID.
4.	Again, when I dealt with the boxplot chart, I could not get a correct graph. That is because I kept using the append function to add value to the new data frame instead of adding lists to it. During the problem research time, I also learned how to make the outliers to be a red dot.
	
Declaration
During the task, I used some syntax, formulas, and functions. Some of them are from class, and some of them are from a web search. When I made an error or had no idea what was going on, I chatted with ChatGPT and got some suggestions or debug for coding. I figured the problem out first and understood it, and then typed the code down. From this view, my work might have some similarities with others. I am a new learner of coding, have to do lots of research and reading for problem-solving.
